# Photo-Magic

## Motivation
Understand other methods of encryption using an array.

## Using Linear Feedback Shift Registers to Encrypt Images
A linear feedback shift register stores a sequence of pseudo-random bits as a one-time pad for encryption. By using the exclusive-or operator, the one-time pad can be used to encrypt and then decrypt. In this project, the one-time pad will be used to encrypt an image then decrypt the image back to its original state.

### Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSR)
The LFSR object is represented by an array that is populated with an initial seed of 1s and 0s. A new bit is derived from the exclusive-or of the first bit and a "tap" bit. The first bit is shifted off and the new bit is placed last in the register. This occurs k times for a k-bit integer. 


### Photo Magic 
The Photo Magic program encrypts photos by iterating through each pixel, then performing the exclusive-or operator on each rgb value with a new 8-bit integer generated by the LFSR.
